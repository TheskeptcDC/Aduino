Clock Display Using MCP23017 and Arduino's Internal Clock

This project demonstrates a clock display system that uses the MCP23017 I/O expander and Arduino's internal clock to display the current time. The system is controlled by an Arduino, which keeps track of the time internally and displays it on a 7-segment display or an LCD connected via the MCP23017.

Components Used
- Arduino
- MCP23017 I/O Expander
- 7-Segment Display
- Connecting Wires

How It Works
1. **Arduino Internal Clock**: The Arduino uses its internal clock to keep track of the current time. Although less precise than an RTC module, it is sufficient for short-term timekeeping.
2. **MCP23017 I/O Expander**: Provides additional GPIO pins to interface with the 7-segment display or LCD.
3. **Arduino**: Maintains the current time and sends the data to the display via the MCP23017.

Notes
- The MCP23017 allows you to expand the number of GPIO pins available for interfacing with the display.


Conclusion
This project is an excellent way to learn about using I2C devices like the MCP23017 with Arduino to create a functional clock display. Although the Arduino's internal clock is less accurate than an RTC module, it is sufficient for basic timekeeping projects. The system can be expanded and customized to suit various display types and formats.
